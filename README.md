# Workout Tracker
This is a simple CRUD app used to track a userâ€™s workouts.

This backend was created with Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. I had my DAO interface extend to JPARepository and therefore, I did not write any SQL queries. The frontend was done with vanilla JavaScript.

Here is a short video that shows a user creating, reading, updating, and deleting their workout entries.
